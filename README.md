# Coordinate-Descent
This is a course project of CSE 251A Introduction to AI A Statistical Approach in UCSD
-------------
Coordinate descent is a simple and useful approach to solve an unconstrained optimization problem. 

Here are the steps:
• Designed and and implemented the Coordinate Descent algorithm to solve the standard unconstrained optimization problem in Machine Learning (Loss Function)
• Compared it with Standard Logistic Regression solver in a binary classification problem
